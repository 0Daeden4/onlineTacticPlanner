# Disclaimer

This project was mostly (like %99) made by AI. I have only stated the functionalities I wanted to have.

# Motivation

Although I think **heavily relying on AI on a project can and should be classified as theft**, I had to find a way to host this file somewhere. I
also intend to delete this repository in a short time, since  I only want to know how I could host this and see whether the idea can be applied.
